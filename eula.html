Upon such termination, you <br>agree to destroy the Software, together with all copies thereof.<br><br><strong>COPYRIGHT/OWNERSHIP</strong> This Software and its source code are proprietary products of Pablo Software Solutions and are protected by copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property laws.<br><br><strong>CHANGE IN POLICIES</strong>: Pablo Software Solutions reserves the right to change these policies at any time. While it is not our intention to do so, there may be factors outside of our control that require us to implement changes to our policies.<br><br>THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS &quot;AS IS&quot; AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT OWNER OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS<br>OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.<br><br>This software was created to be free of defects and is designed to function on PC computers only. While this software has been tested <br>and proven to run accurately, in the unlikely event of any user or computer incompatibility issues, the end user assumes complete <br>liability of usage. This software contains no adware, scumware or spyware. The maker of this software does not support any <br>questionable forms of use where this software could be misused in any way. <br><br><strong>EXTENSIONS</strong> are made available as an extra service for registered users, they are not an official part of the software and therefore cannot be used in the trial version. Pablo Software Solutions will not offer&nbsp; support for third party extensions and is in no way responsible for&nbsp; proper functioning of these extensions. <br><br><strong>WARNING</strong>: The use of cracks or serial number generators can make your projects useless in the future. When using this software with an <br>illegal license you'll risk losing all your hard work! Also when you publish your website online created with illegal software you risk having your website closed due copyright infringement.<br><br><strong>REFUND POLICY</strong>: Pablo Software Solutions products are all downloadable, fully functional, and try-before-you-buy. <br>We provide a free 30 day trial version of our software for your convenience to fully evaluate in your computing environment.<br>If you purchase one of our products, after your credit card or check is approved, an email will be sent to you with the activation key to unlock the software. Once this information is emailed to you, there will be no refunds given. We must enforce this policy since it would be impossible for you to return your registered version of our software. We strongly recommend that all users download, install, and test the fully functional trial versions prior to making a purchase. Once you have activated the software you will no longer qualify for a refund. Because there is no way to guarantee that our software was actually removed from a system after it is installed, this allows us to help fight fraudulent activity.<br><br><strong>UPGRADE POLICY</strong>: <br><strong>Updates (fixes/small new features) are free.<br></strong>For example if you've purchased version 12 then the current version 12.x is available free of charge for registered users. The software is updated very frequently. Updates and extra features are being release almost every month (for free!).<br>Check out the news section of the forum for the latest announcements: <a href="https://www.wysiwygforum.tk/viewforum_3.htm" class="wwb_link" target="_blank">http://wysiwygwebbuilder.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=1</a><br><br><strong>Upgrades (major new versions) are not free</strong> but can be purchased with a discount. Developing a major new version requires significant research, design, development and testing time. Once a year we also release a complete new version (=upgrade) with many new features and enhancements. For example: version 12 has more than 125 new features and improvements compare to version 11.6! The upgrade price is usually 33% of the current sales price.<br><br>We do not force you to purchase an upgrade. Older versions will continue to work the way they did when you've purchased them.<br>If a new version will be released within 60 days after your purchase, you will get the upgrade free of charge.</span></div>
